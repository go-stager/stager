Stager takes the pain out of staging changes to your development server.
Instead of having a single instance that everyone uses for staging, Stager
lets you spin up instances on demand simply by visiting a URL.

### Features

Stager offers the following features:

 - Flexibility in what gets staged (branches, commits, etc.)
 - The ability to run more than one instance simultaneously
 - Automatic cleanup of instances that are no longer used
